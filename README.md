# Analysis With Excel
Excel is a powerful tool offering many features for data analysis. In this work,
excel I use to clean data, organize, create pivot table, generate vizualizations and draw conclusions as data stories.

## Dataset
The dataset used was obtained from the internet. Check it [here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx).

## Dashboard
The dashboard features simple yet clear visualizations generatated out of pivot tables.
### Static
A folder with .jpeg image of the dashboard if you cannot load the dashboard.

# Conclusion
Excel has been here, and its henceforth existence is evident by its ability to handle almost all kinds of data analysis.
